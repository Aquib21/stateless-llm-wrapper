# stateless-llm-wrapper
Developing a software wrapper that integrates a base Language Model (LLM) with LangChain to provide enhanced reasoning capabilities, focusing on real-time interactions without maintaining conversation history. This setup should facilitate handling complex reasoning queries akin to conversational Al platforms like ChatGPT.

The purpose of this project is to develop a software wrapper that integrates a base Language Model (LLM) with LangChain to provide enhanced reasoning capabilities for real-time interactions, without maintaining conversation history. This setup aims to facilitate handling complex reasoning queries similar to conversational AI platforms like ChatGPT.
The key highlights of this project are:
Integration with LangChain: The system leverages LangChain to enhance the LLM's reasoning capabilities, enabling it to handle more complex, logic-based queries effectively. LangChain provides a standard interface for chains, integrations with other tools, and end-to-end chains for common applications.
Stateless Operation: The system operates in a stateless manner, processing each query independently without maintaining conversation history. This allows for real-time interactions without the need to store or manage previous interactions.
By combining a robust LLM with LangChain's reasoning and acting capabilities, this project aims to create a powerful and flexible system that can handle complex queries and provide intelligent responses, similar to advanced conversational AI platforms.
Select a robust LLM like GPT-3 or GPT-4 that can understand and generate human-like text.
Install LangChain and the LLM's Python library in your development environment.
Initialize the LLM and wrap it with LangChain's LLMChain** to enable chaining prompts and responses
LangChain's LLMChain operates in a stateless manner, so each query is processed independently without maintaining conversation history.
To add memory, use LangChain's Memory components like ChatMessageHistory to store and pass context from previous interactions.
Developing the User Interface
Choose a modern UI framework like React or Angular to create a clean, intuitive interface.
Design the UI with a text input for queries and an area to display responses.
Implement the frontend components, ensuring responsiveness and user-friendliness.
Implementing the Backend API
Set up a backend server using a framework like Flask or FastAPI to handle incoming queries.
Create a /query endpoint to receive user queries from the frontend.
Process the incoming queries using the LLMChain integrated with LangChain.
Send the processed responses back to the frontend in JSON format for display to the user.
Testing and Deployment
Perform functional testing to ensure the LLM and LangChain correctly process queries and return appropriate responses.
Conduct usability testing to verify the UI meets end-user needs.
Prepare the application for deployment and choose a suitable hosting environment.
By following these steps, you can develop a stateless LLM wrapper with LangChain to enhance reasoning capabilities for real-time interactions, similar to conversational AI platforms like ChatGPT.
